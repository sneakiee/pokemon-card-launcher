# BONUS! (what's this?)

here's a little addition to the project! by adding an RFID reader, we can change the OLED screen to display a pokemon! with the power of a pokeball and sticky tack anything is possible!!!!!! (i'm putting sticky tack on an NFC tag that isn't a sticker and then slapping it on the front of the pokeball LOL) There's also a trainer card! If you really don't wanna carry around a pokeball HAHA

__**you may ask, why?**__

as one of the members of the power rangers mega-team at undercity, we attempted to add an RFID reader to our project. unfortunately we were running out of time, and couldn't figure it out so we were left wondering how to even operate an RFID reader/writer. Only the team with the morpher were able to figure it out, but at the same time they didn't know how to help us :(

in attempts to learn instead of doing nothing, especially after hearing about how my project may or may not be good enough for at least 4 points... i decided i was going to learn AND add more to my project in hopes and in beggings (PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE) to get my full travel stipend.
