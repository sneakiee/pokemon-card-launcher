# Pokémon Card Launcher

Ever wanted to flex your cards, since you don't have money? HAHA! Use this instead of a money gun!

Inspired by the famous money gun, a pokemon card launcher, self explanatory--it launches Pokémon cards! It also has a screen that can display whatever you want :P
Also surprisingly compatible with many other types of cards, such as regular playing cards or other trading card games!

Originally this was gonna be made out of cardboard but then Selena told me to 3D print it so now we have a really refined version of this pokemon card gun, I just wanted to spit out cards like a money gun LOL
