# July 23rd: Experimenting with Onshape

I didn't do much honestly, I just started the CAD while waiting for my 3D print for my hackpad, turns out I have no idea what I'm doing but whatever LOL. I also made the top flap, lowkey proud of it.

# July 20th-July 26th: Actually doing the wiring diagram!?!

The true beginnings of my project!! I started the wiring diagram out with TinkerCAD, probably the worst decision of my life... I had literally no choice but to switch to ol' handy dandy paint.net! ANYWAY, I got a lil busy with plans with friends and procrastinated (thats why there is like a 6-day buffer) but finally finished at 4:25AM on the 26th. I seriously couldn't find good sources because they all said different things D: Anyway, looked through as many things as I could during that time and finally ended up with this mess of a wiring diagram, chose the raspberry pi pico out of convenience as I have some orpheus picos.

**Total Time Spent:** 4h

# July 29th-July 30th: procrastination.... (more CAD!)

I got a little busy with real life (touching grass and whatever) and was very tired, but I did cad most of the body, which was lowkey rough because I had almost no CAD experience other than hackpad so I was just playing around with things and then my sketches got weird or whatever and I couldn't resize them properly... Onshape is so much fun ._. Now, all I had to do was make sure I had space for everything and create screwholes for the top and the bottoms.

**Total Time Spent:** 3h

# July 31st: fINAL sTRETCH

I went ahead and resized some things and then finished up with the CAD! I made the whole body, adjusted the body to have a handle thats actually holdable, made the bottoms, the top, the trigger (which is literally a 3d printed piece on a button), screwholes and assembled it all together, finally finishing the design for this project! + I did my firmware just look at how big the byte array is LOL (I actually forgot to do my firmware right before I submitted for the form and realized when I had to link my repo...) Luckily all my firmware needed to have is the code to display a pokeball and turning on and off the motor through the button and L298N :'D

# August 5th-6th: bonus time >:)

Unfortunately after all my effort to create the project before the due date, I was told that my project was only worth 2. FLIPPIN. POINTS. as someone who was busy but still tried to find time to finish my project I was lowkey hurt </3 I needed (and still do) my stipend for undercity (amazing event !!!) and lowkey went in a panic, but you know what? It does NOT mean I should give up! In days of struggle and anxiety waiting for my review from another reviewer, I decided to step up my game (kind of) and create a little bonus feature that I couldn't create in my build at undercity. THE ADDITION OF AN RFID! (this is really just a hail mary to get my full stipend... please please please please please please please please please please please **i just need 4 points**)

First, I decided to upgrade my CAD. I realized that my hackpad did not stay together due to the bigger holes not doing anything on my hackpad (hey we learn from our mistakes AWESOME!) Guess what! Screwholes are now fixed BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOOOOOOM!
picture example (cuz theres a few of them) :p

Not only that I decided to make a spot for my RFID module to sit! (right above the trigger in the bottom piece!)

After all that I DECIDED, WE GONNA PUT THAT NFC KEY ON A POKEBALL WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO (WE CAN CAD NOW !?!?!)

Now I had to add it to my wiring diagram, nothing too difficult, just gotta put it in the right GP slots and we good... right? HAHAH YUP. WE GOOD, WE RIGHT.

Okay, now we had to run the firmware, but how was I gonna do it? I ran into some problems with this one, having to use an RFID, when I haven't used one before? All the references I was looking at had nothing I understood or were mostly unrelated to what I wanted to do. BUT WE NEVER GIVE UP IN THIS HOUSEHOLD (because we are broke and are j*bless.. plus we aren't CLOSE to middle class and we truly need the stipend </3 AND WE ARE ALSO GOING TO UNIVERSITY. EVEN MORE BROKE!!!!!) Finally found the resources and created an NFC writer and implemented the reading NFC tags in the new bonus firmware (check it out! WOOOOOOOOO)
pictures :3

But then I realized something, the RFID kit had a card?! WE MAKING TRAINER CARDS IN THIS WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! (this took so long omg... i'm sad i can't magazine this)
unfortunately i got really tired so um i didn't finish the trainer card yet, **renders and trainer card coming soon!**

**Total Time Spent:** 4h
