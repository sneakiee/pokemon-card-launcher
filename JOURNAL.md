# July 23rd: Experimenting with Onshape

I just started the CAD while waiting for my 3D print for my hackpad, turns out I have no idea what I'm doing but whatever LOL. I also made the top flap, lowkey proud of it.

# July 20th-July 26th: Actually doing the wiring diagram!?!

I started the wiring diagram out with TinkerCAD, probably the worst decision of my life... I had literally no choice but to switch to ol' handy dandy paint.net! ANYWAY, I got a lil busy with plans with friends and procrastinated (thats why there is like a 6-day buffer) but finally finished at 4:25AM on the 26th. I seriously couldn't find good sources because they all said different things. D:
