# July 23rd: Experimenting with Onshape

I didn't do much honestly, I just started the CAD while waiting for my 3D print for my hackpad, turns out I have no idea what I'm doing but whatever LOL. I also made the top flap, lowkey proud of it.

# July 20th-July 26th: Actually doing the wiring diagram!?!

The true beginnings of my project!! I started the wiring diagram out with TinkerCAD, probably the worst decision of my life... I had literally no choice but to switch to ol' handy dandy paint.net! ANYWAY, I got a lil busy with plans with friends and procrastinated (thats why there is like a 6-day buffer) but finally finished at 4:25AM on the 26th. I seriously couldn't find good sources because they all said different things D: Anyway, looked through as many things as I could during that time and finally ended up with this mess of a wiring diagram, chose the raspberry pi pico out of convenience as I have some orpheus picos.

# July 29th-July 30th: procrastination.... (more CAD!)

I got a little busy with real life (touching grass and whatever) and was very tired, but I did cad most of the body, now all I had to do was make sure I had space for everything and create screwholes for the top and the bottoms.

# July 31st: fINAL sTRETCH

I went ahead and resized some things and then finished up with the CAD! I made the whole body, adjusted the body to have a handle thats actually holdable, made the bottoms, the top, screwholes and assembled it all together, finally finishing the design for this project! + I did my firmware just look at how big the byte array is LOL (I actually forgot to do my firmware right before I submitted for the form and realized when I had to link my repo...) Luckily all my firmware needed to have is the code to display a pokeball and turning on and off the motor through the button and L298N :'D
